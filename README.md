# commerce
Commerce, though not fully complete, is my first major project using Django. By implementing Python, Jinja, Django, and SQLite, I demonstrate my ability to work with these languages and frameworks. 

To access my code, navigate to auctions => (any .py document) as well as templates/auctions => (any .html file)
